!!! info "Testing with other devices"

    To test the application with other devices in your network, you can access your application at [`https://xxx-yyy-zzz-www.openvidu-local.dev:5443`](), where `xxx-yyy-zzz-www` part of the domain is your LAN private IP address with dashes (-) instead of dots (.). For more information, see section [Accessing your deployment from other devices in your LAN](/installation/local/#accessing-your-deployment-from-other-devices-in-your-lan){target="_blank"}.

    To use the application from outside your network, a production deployment is required.
